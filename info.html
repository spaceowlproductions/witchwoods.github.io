                <strong>Witchwood is an interactive database for witchy foraging lore.<br></strong>
                <br>
                The information on the flora of Witchwood is collected from <em>A Witch's Brew</em>
                by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelma_Simmons">Adelma Grenier Simmons</a>,
                who was one of the leading herbal figures in America in the 20th century. 
                I happened upon a copy of this rare out of print publication, and decided
                to use it as inspiration for this website. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I think the internet lacks a certain <em>magic</em> and I don't seem to be alone in this thinking.
                I often find that the aesthetics of the information I'm digging into, and the aesthetics of the websites where I'm digging are at odds with eachother.
                What better way to learn about the witchy uses of various plants and herbs than to step into a digital forest and ask the witch themselves?
                <br>
                <br>
                This is a work in progress and is just scratching the surface of where I can imagine taking this project.
